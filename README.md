Study of factors influencing the daily cost of accommodation in Warsaw

1.  Problem Description
The development of a modern tourism economy, considering the perspectives for the development of Polish tourism in the 21st-century economy, is largely determined by the development of the hotel industry. Still, the key places for the hotel industry include major cities such as Warsaw.
In the process of searching for accommodation in the capital of Poland, many factors are taken into account. The development of the Internet has significantly changed the conditions of operation and competition in the hotel industry. One of the elements of this new reality is electronic consumer ratings and the ability to post reviews, which we consider when choosing a hotel. Usually, accommodation offers in the very center of Warsaw are somewhat more expensive, but the convenient location means that you have the greatest attractions in the area at your disposal. When deciding on a specific hotel, we also consider access to free parking or the size of the apartment. What really influences the cost of accommodation in Warsaw?

2. Project Objective
Many people who would like to visit Warsaw are convinced that the prices for accommodation in Warsaw are high â€“ including for apartments and rooms for short-term rent and are interested in the cheapest solution. Is a high price always synonymous with a good location, or does a hotel having a good user rating on a website mean a high accommodation cost?
The aim of the presented project is to examine the impact of 9 factors on the price of daily accommodation in Warsaw and to determine the strength of their impact.

3. Verification of Hypotheses
After conducting the research, we can verify the truth of the research hypotheses:
1) The distance from the Royal Castle has the strongest impact on the cost of accommodation. FALSE
2) The size of the apartment does not affect the cost of accommodation. FALSE
3) The better the user rating on the website, the more expensive the accommodation. TRUE
4) The closer to the Royal Castle, the more expensive the accommodation. TRUE

3. Final Model

\[y = -64.19 + 24.26x_1 + 2.92x_2 + \epsilon\]

where:
- \(x_1\): user rating
- \(x_2\): apartment area

This means that an increase in the user rating on bookin.com by 1 unit results in an increase in the accommodation price by 24.3 PLN, and with each \(m^2\) of apartment area, the price of accommodation in Warsaw increases by 3 PLN. Surprisingly, the availability of a bathroom in the room and free parking turned out to be insignificant.
The conducted study shows the relationships between the factors that we take into account when choosing a place to stay and the cost of accommodation.
